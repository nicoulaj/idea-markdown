            <p>This package is used to comfortably manage, view, edit and translate Laravel language files with translation assistance through the Yandex Translation API. It augments the Laravel Translator system with a ton of practical functionality. <a href="#features">Features</a></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Master branch is now for Laravel version 5.1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For Laravel 4.2 use the Laravel4 branch, or require: <code>&quot;vsch/laravel-translation-manager&quot;: &quot;~1.0&quot;</code></li>
                    <li>For Laravel 5.1 use the master branch, or require: <code>&quot;vsch/laravel-translation-manager&quot;: &quot;~2.0&quot;</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>New file layout configuration can handle non-standard location and layout of translation files. The main motivator for the change was to eliminate differences in code between the two Laravel versions to ease maintenance, the added benefit is that now Translation Manager can import and publish translations located anywhere in the project tree and is configured to handle vendor and workbench subdirectories. This does require publishing of the new configuration files to your project and manually applying any changes you have made to them. You should rename your current configuration file before publishing a new one so you can merge your changes into the new file. <a href="#publishing-configuration">publishing configuration</a></p>

                <p><strong>Initial Localizations Added</strong><br/>Only en and ru locales were manually verified. All others are there as a starter set and were automatically generated via Yandex by using the new Auto Translate feature in the web interface.<br/>Any help in cleaning them up would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                <li>allow in-database translations to override the ones in the language files. Used to update translations on server clusters where updating translation files is not possible (like AWS EC2) or would cause server code to be out of sync.</li>
                <li>assisted translation with Yandex API integrated into the web interface that handle choice type translations and preserve replacement parameters. <a href="#yandex-translation-supported-languages">Yandex Translation Supported Languages</a></li>
                <li>auto-translate empty translations.</li>
                <li>allow editing in place of translation strings right in your web pages. This may require some rework of your blade/php view files.</li>

            <h4><a href="#workflow" name="workflow" id="workflow" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Import translations: Read all translation files and save them in the database</li>
                <li>Optionally: Find all translations in php/twig sources</li>
                <li>Optionally: Log missing translations, even in a production environment</li>
                <li>Translate all keys through the web interface</li>
                <li>Publish all translations back to the translation files or cache if in production environment where writing of files is not an option.</li>
                <li>Optionally: Download zipped translations. The zip archive will contain the files that would be exported to the resources/lang directory so it is easy to replace translations on your development system without being able to write files in productions or connect your local system to production database.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This way, translations can be saved in git history and no overhead is introduced in production.</p>

            <h2><a href="#web-interface" name="web-interface" id="web-interface" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web Interface</h2>
            <p>When you have imported your translation (via buttons or command), you can view them in the web interface (on the url you defined the with the controller).<br/>You can click on a translation and an edit field will popup. All translations are saved when the edit dialog is closed unless it is closed with the cancel button. Clicking anywhere on the page outside the edit dialog will save the current changes.<br/>When a translation is not yet created in a different locale, you can also just edit it to create it.</p>
            <p>Using the buttons on the web interface, you can import/export the translations. For publishing translations, make sure your application can write to the language directory or optionally configure it to do in-database publishing using the cache by adding:</p>
            <p>The web interface lets you select the locale:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>for the web interface, that is used to display the translator web interface.</li>
                <li>the primary locale. Used to provide the source text and locale for translations. Also lists it as the first locale in the translation table.</li>
                <li>the translating locale, the one that you are currently translating, so it is moved to the second column in the translation table. You are free to edit any translation displayed on the page. Translation assistance is available to translate from the primary locale to the locale of the string you are editing.</li>
                <li>You can select which additional locales to display on the page by checking the locales and clicking on the &lsquo;Working Set&rsquo; button to apply your selection. For convenience you can clear all via the &ldquo;None&rdquo; or set all via the &ldquo;All&rdquo; buttons.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3><a href="#dashboard-view" name="dashboard-view" id="dashboard-view" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dashboard View</h3>
            <p>Here you can see a summary by group what was deleted, changed or is missing in the translation files. The group is a link that will display its translations for editing.</p>
            <h3><a href="#edit-in-place" name="edit-in-place" id="edit-in-place" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Edit In Place</h3>
            <p>The &ldquo;Edit In Place&rdquo; button will allow you to edit all Translation Manager web interface translation strings right in the page. If you want to try this mode you will need to publish the Translation Manager language files to your project so you can view and edit them in the web interface, as described in <a href="#step10">step 10</a>.</p>
            <p>If you do not copy the package language files then all translation edit links will display as Empty and editing them will create an override in your project for the translation when you &lsquo;Publish&rsquo; the group &lsquo;laravel-translation-manager::messages&rsquo; or &lsquo;Publish All&rsquo;.</p>
            <h3><a href="#edit-pop-up" name="edit-pop-up" id="edit-pop-up" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Edit Pop-Up</h3>
            <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsch/laravel-translation-manager/master/images/ScreenShot_edit_popup.png" alt="Edit Pop-up Screenshot" /></p>
            <p>All changes to translations are done via this pop-up. It has convenience buttons to help with frequent operations.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Save changes. Additionally you can click anywhere on the page to have your changes saved.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cancel. No changes are saved.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Convert translation key to text. The resulting text will be the text of the translation key with . - _ changed to spaces and all words capitalized. Useful for generating text from keys quickly.</p>
                    <p>This button appears when editing the primary locale. For all others it is replaced by image 13. In this case it replaces the translation text with the translated text of the primary locale.</p>
                    <p>If the primary locale is a <code>choice()</code> format text then will attempt to create translated version of the same. For Russian it will generate 3 forms: singular, count of 2 and count of 5. For all other languages just two: singular and plural for count of 2.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Generate plural forms for use in <code>\Lang::choice()</code>. When editing the primary locale will convert the translation key text to singular|plural. When editing any other locales will simply duplicate the entered text separated by | for manual editing.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Capitalize every word</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lowercase all text</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Copy text (simulated clipboard copy, value preserved as long as the page is not replaced).</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Paste text that was copied with 7.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Restore text to what it was when the pop-up was opened.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Restore text to last published or last imported value.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Title shows: [locale] group.key that is being edited. Useful in &lsquo;in place edit&rsquo; mode to find the translation id of some text on the page.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Text editing area.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Translate primary text to locale currently being edited. The button text shows {primary locale}-&gt;{editing locale}. The locale being edited can be any locale displayed on the page, does not have to be the one selected in the Translate locale selection. See 3. for details.</p></li>

            <p>Enter keys you want to create/delete from the current group in the left text area, and optionally any suffixes you want to permute with the keys on the left. For example, keys: abc, def, ghi; with suffixes: 1,2,3 will create/delete: abc1, abc2, abc3, def1, def2, def3, ghi1, ghi2, ghi3.</p>
            <p>The search button displays the search dialog which will display translation strings and keys that contain the text being searched. You can use the &lsquo;%&rsquo; wildcard character in the search text to give you finer control, if you don&rsquo;t provide one the text you enter will be surrounded by &lsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>
            <p>You can edit the resulting translations directly in the search dialog results table or follow the group link to display the group&rsquo;s translation page.</p>

            <p>The package has only been tested with MySQL backend. No MySQL specific syntax is being used but no other backend has been tested with the package.</p>
            <p>Translation helpers use Yandex. You can edit any locale, even if it is not supported by Yandex. However, automatic translation will not work for unsupported locales. See <a href="#yandex-supported-languages">Yandex Supported languages</a></p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Require this package in your composer.json and run composer update (or run <code>composer require vsch/laravel-translation-manager:*</code> directly):</p>
    <pre><code>&quot;vsch/laravel-translation-manager&quot;: &quot;~2.0&quot;
    </code></pre>
                    <ul>
                        <li>if you are not going to be customizing the web interface it is highly recommended that you add automatic asset publishing for this package after upgrade in your project&rsquo;s composer.json:
        <pre><code>&quot;php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\&quot;Vsch\\TranslationManager\\ManagerServiceProvider\&quot; --tag=public&quot;,

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Otherwise a future update, that needs new assets, will not work properly. composer does not run post-update scripts of packages.</p>
                    <p>Here is a full scripts section of a standard Laravel 4.2 project composer.json should look like after the change.</p>

                    <p>The TranslationServiceProvider is an extension to the standard functionality and is required in order for the web interface to work properly. It is backward compatible with the existing Translator since it is a subclass of it and only overrides implementation for new features.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><a name="step8"></a>TranslationManager uses the vsch/user-privilege-mapper package that creates a mapping layer between your User model implementation and the need to test user privileges without knowing the implementation. You need to name privileges for the UserPrivilegeMapper via the Laravel macro mechanism. This should be done in the initialization files. A good place is the app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php file, add the following to boot() function, if your User model has is_admin and is_editor attributes to identify users that have Admin and Editor privileges or just <code>return true</code> in both cases if you don&rsquo;t have any way of determining user privileges:</p>
    <pre><code>\UserCan::macro(&quot;admin_translations&quot;, function ()
        {

                    <p>In this example the User model implements two attributes: is_admin and is_editor. The admin user is allowed to manage translations: import, delete, export, etc., the editor user can only edit existing translations. However, both of these users will always log missing translation keys so that any missing translations will be visible to them instead of relying on the missing key lottery settings.</p>

            <h2><a href="#configuration" name="configuration" id="configuration" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h2>
            <p>The config file <code>app/config/packages/laravel-translation-manager/config.php</code> has comments that provide a description for each option. Note that when <code>admin_enabled</code> is set to <code>false</code> then translation management is limited to editing existing translations all other operations have to be done through the command line. Ideally, this option needs to be dynamic based on user privileges so that translators cannot delete translations or administer translations but admins can. See <a href="#step8">step 8</a> above.</p>
            <p>By default the primary locale is <code>en</code>. The primary locale determines what language is used for the source text for the translate button in the edit pop-up and can be changed in the web interface for the current session. When editing the text for the primary locale a button in the edit pop-up allows you to convert the text of the key to a default value (change . - _ to spaces, capitalize first letter of each word) that way you can generate descent placeholder text to continue development and replace it with more meaningful value later.</p>
            <p>By default the configuration will load all translations found in the standard Laravel locations. In the table below {vendor}, {package}, {locale}, {group} are placeholders for their corresponding values referring to vendor name, package name, locale string and translation group. The translation group will consist of optional sub-directory tree and the file name, allowing you to organize your translation files.</p>

            <h2><a href="#artisan-commands" name="artisan-commands" id="artisan-commands" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Artisan Commands</h2>
            <p>You can also use the commands below.</p>
            <h3><a href="#import-command" name="import-command" id="import-command" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Import command</h3>
            <p>The import command will load all translations in the <code>resources/lang</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code>    $ php artisan translations:import
</code></pre>
            <p>Note: By default, only new strings are added. Translations already in the DB are kept the same. If you want to replace all values with the ones from the files,<br/>add the <code>--replace</code> (or <code>-R</code>) option: <code>php artisan translations:import --replace</code></p>
            <h3><a href="#find-translations-in-source" name="find-translations-in-source" id="find-translations-in-source" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Find translations in source</h3>
            <p>The Find command and the web interface &lsquo;Add References&rsquo; button will search for all php/twig files in the app directory for translation functions. It will do its best to extract the group/item names. If you have a lot of dynamically generated keys expect some false positives to show up in the database that you will need to delete via the web interface.</p>
            <p>The found keys will be added to the database, so they can be easily translated.<br/>This can be done through the web interface, or via an Artisan command.</p>
<pre><code>    $ php artisan translations:find
</code></pre>
            <h3><a href="#export-command" name="export-command" id="export-command" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Export command</h3>
            <p>The export command will write the contents of the database back to app/lang php files.<br/>This will overwrite existing translations and remove all comments, so make sure to backup your data before using.</p>
            <p>Supply the group name to define which groups you want to publish.</p>
<pre><code>    $ php artisan translations:export &lt;group&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>For example, <code>php artisan translations:export reminders</code> when you have 2 locales (en/nl), will write to <code>resources/lang/en/reminders.php</code> and <code>resources/lang/nl/reminders.php</code></p>
            <h3><a href="#clean-command" name="clean-command" id="clean-command" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clean command</h3>
            <p>The clean command will search for all translation that are NULL and delete them, so your interface is a bit cleaner. Empty translations are never exported to language files.</p>
<pre><code>    $ php artisan translations:clean
</code></pre>
            <h3><a href="#reset-command" name="reset-command" id="reset-command" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reset command</h3>
            <p>The reset command clears all translation in the database, so you can start fresh (by a new import). Make sure to export your work or download a zip archive of it, to make sure you don&rsquo;t irretrievably blow away your or someone else&rsquo;s work.</p>
<pre><code>    $ php artisan translations:reset
</code></pre>
            <h2><a href="#new-features" name="new-features" id="new-features" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New Features</h2>
            <p>These features were added since the code diverged from the original <code>barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager</code> package:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>translation manager web-interface is now fully localized. Current version has English and Russian locales. Others can be easily added by adding package translation overrides in <code>app/lang/vendor/laravel-translation-manager/{locale}/messages.php</code> files and generating a pull request so that they could be incorporated into the package.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>import was optimized to work well, even when connecting to a remote database server.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>exported language files are formatted to align <code>=&gt;</code> for a given level of keys, making it easier to deal with these files manually if needed.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>exported language files preserve multi-line comments, doc comments and empty first level array values.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>added in-database translations overrides to the translations in files. Making it possible to update the site&rsquo;s translations without needed a new deployment.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>publishing translations on production systems where updating translation files would only update a single server, can be configured to use the cache for serving up the modified translations. This allows translations to be updated live without having to redeploy a new version of the language files.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Translation service can be put into &lsquo;in place edit&rsquo; mode that enables editing of translations where they appear on the page.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>this eliminates the need to peruse code to find the translation group/key combination that is used for the resulting string and then looking for it in the translation files or in the web interface. Simply enable in-place editing mode and click on the errant string you wish to edit.</li>
                        <li>This functionality may require some editing of view files to handle: string values that should not be links because they are not shown or are used for HTML attribute values, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> contents that don&rsquo;t display links and other edge cases.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>changes to database translations that have not been published show a colour coded difference between previously published/imported translations and current unpublished changes.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>soft delete of translations that can be undone until translations are published eliminating the annoyance of either a confirmation for every delete or an Oh! S&ndash;t, I hit the wrong key.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>translation page has a dash board view showing all unpublished changes, missing translations and deleted translations.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>handling package translation overrides located in <code>resources/lang/vendor/{package}/{locale}</code></p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>handling of translation files in subdirectories both the <code>resources/lang/{locale}/</code> and package override translations in <code>resources/lang/vendor/{package}/{locale}</code> to allow managing package translation overrides.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>missing translation key logging that can be used in a production environment by setting 1 of N sessions to actually log missing translations. Since checking for missing translation requires hitting the database for every translation, it can be a heavy load on the DB server. This configuration setting allows randomly selecting 1 of N user sessions to be marked as checking for missing translations allowing the benefit of finding missing translations while reducing the load burden on the server.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>in place edit mode inside the search dialog to allow editing of translation in the search result.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Yandex translation API for assisting in the translation process.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>extra buttons added to the bootstrap x-edit component for frequent operations:<br/> - change case of translation or selection within translation: lowercase, first cap<br/> - create plural forms for use in <code>choice()</code>, currently English is automatically created and Russian will do its best by using Yandex translator to derive the plural forms.<br/> - recall translation text from last saved or last published.<br/> - simulated copy/paste buttons. Work only if the page is not reloaded and only within the translation edit dialog.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>moved the delete translation icon before the translation key instead of after the last translation because for large number of locales it was impossible to know which key was going to be marked for deletion.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>added a working set of locales to limit number of locales displayed on the page to reduce clutter and page load time.</p></li>

            <p>This package is still in development although it is successfully being used to manage translations. Here is a list of to do&rsquo;s and limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>MySQL DB is assumed for queries in those places where Eloquent was too cumbersome or too inefficient. I will be refactoring all DB access that bypasses Eloquent into a TranslationRepository interface class so that new DB access will only need to create a new repository implementation class for a specific DB interface.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>only Yandex assisted translations are implemented. Google translate was not used since it has no free option. However it is a simple change in the <code>translator.js</code> file to handle alternate translation engines. I will be making a configurable item in the future.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>key operations that allow creating new keys and also keys permuted by suffixes, moving, copying, deleting keys are a bit of a kludge. I am planning to rework the web interface to make these cleaner. However, if you desperately need these to save a lot of typing and editing, the current version will do the trick.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Suggestions and priority requests are welcome. :)</p>
            <h2><a href="#history-and-origins" name="history-and-origins" id="history-and-origins" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History and Origins</h2>
            <p>This package was originally based on Barry vd. Heuvel&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager">barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager</a> package.</p>
            <p>I was creating an English/Russian site on a tight schedule and managing translations was a serious burden. When I saw Barry&rsquo;s package, I instantly decided that it was a must have. Right away I could see that it needed some features to make it into serious translator&rsquo;s workhorse. The code base diverged very quickly and I decided to publish it as a separate package so that others can experience the joy of creating localized sites without the pain, blood, sweat nor tears.</p></article>
